1.Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.      
2.Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.     
3.Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

**ðŸš€ Project Requirements**:

**Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)**:

**Objective**:

        Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

 **Specifications**:
 
      1.Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.        
      2.Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.             
      3.Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.         
      4.Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.          
      5.Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.         

**BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)**:
**Objective**:
        Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

        1.Customer Behavior
        2.Product Performance
        3.Sales Trends

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
